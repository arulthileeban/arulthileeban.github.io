I'm a software engineer obsessed with building a more secure and resilient internet, specializing in the critical infrastructure that protects user access and data. At Bloomberg, I've architected a Zero Trust proxy that reliably processes ~2 million requests per day and developed a VPN service from the ground up, now used daily by ~10,000 engineers. My passion extends to the open-source community, where I've contributed to the mTLS capabilities of Envoy and Pomerium and fortified security filters in Firefox. Driven by a background in network security and machine learning for threat detection, I'm constantly seeking out the next complex security challenge to solve.
