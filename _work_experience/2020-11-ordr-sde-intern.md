Worked on threat-detection systems focused on detecting ransomware and anomalous lateral movement in enterprise networks.

- Developed an LSTM-based model for real-time detection of ransomware by analyzing SMB lateral movement patterns.
- Designed and contributed to a ransomware risk-rating prototype using an HMM over Snort IDS logs.
- Built data ingest pipelines leveraging LXC containers and Kafka for scalable processing and evaluation.

Tech stack: TensorFlow, Snort, LXC, Kafka.
